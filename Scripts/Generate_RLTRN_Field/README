Script requires U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) 30 m digital elevation model (DEM) for the central and southern Appalachians (within 34-40ยบ N, 87-78ยบ W) to run as written. May be used for additional regions but requires tweaking. This code was graciously provided by Dr. Branden Katona and tweaked to generate a visual reference (i.e., Fig. 2).
