The following CSVs contain 5 min output analyses generated by passing each simulation output through the tracking algorthm script. These CSVs have been manually reviewed and corrected for any significant tracking errors (i.e., algorithm temporarily locked on to another cell) to generate clean figures for the publication. RAW CSV data is available upon request.
