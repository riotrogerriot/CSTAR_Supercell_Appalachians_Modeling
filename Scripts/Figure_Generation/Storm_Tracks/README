The following scripts were used to generate figures discussed in the results section of the publication. Replicating our results are conditional on the 5-min output CSVs (Generated by the tracking algorithm) along with the final model output file (required for UH swath and RLTRN generation in some Figures). Even with the checks in place, our tracking algorithm did fail between some time steps, in which case data cleaning was required in the 5-min output CSVs. A time-weighted difference was used to interpolated the  data for any respective time-step presenting a tracking error (i.e., t = [ (t + dt) + (t - dt) ] / 2). Results were insensitive to these interpolations and simply provided cleaner visuals. Note that tracking errors were infrequent and were often associated with weakening/dissipating and/or storm-splitting. Robust supercells were efficently tracked by the algorithm. Raw figures often required cleaning and additional annotations completed in Adobe Photoshop.
