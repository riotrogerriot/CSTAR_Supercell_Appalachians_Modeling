The upstream noncrossing outbreak-only composite only consisted of 3/37 observed noncrossing supercells (Purpura et al. 2023). The resulting environment was highly unfavorable for supercells (e.g., MLCAPE ~ 500 J/kg) which was further impacted by the inclusion of realistic terrain. Consequentially, this background environment was ineffective in sustaining simulated convection and the inclusion of it in this repository is soley for replication purposes. Post-processing was unnecessary given the lack of sustained convection.
