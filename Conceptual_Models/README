The following images summarize the impacts of four-key terrain-induced processes (i.e., Terrain-Blocking; Channeling; Upslope and Downslope Flow) on isolated supercell morphology, as derived from a cumulative review of our simulations. Detailed walkthroughs are included in the publication with the conceptual model figures included here for full-resolution references.
